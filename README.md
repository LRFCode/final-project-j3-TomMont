# Cosmic Comic Collector

I created this program for comic collectors, such as myself, to achieve organization of their collection.
It achieves this through the following:

* Allows user to add comics from their collection to the program
* Sorts comics in a List screen with several sections of information on each comic in their collection
* Allows user to edit any comic in their collection and their attributes
* Calculates and displays information about their entire collection as a whole


The end user screens of this program are the following:

### List

Where the user can see and scroll through all the comics in their collection

*screen insert here*

### Specific Comic

Where the user can view more attributes of a specific comic as well as a larger cover image

*screen insert here*

### Add Comic

Where the user can add a new comic to their collection

*screen insert here*

### Edit Specific Comic

Accessed by an Edit button from List or Specific Comic views, allows user to change comic attributes

*screen insert here*

### Statistics

Screen that gives information on the users entire collection.

*screen insert here*


To do list:

* Adjust tables so that user can add a brand new title on the Add Comic screen as opposed to a new issue of an already existing title.
* Add an API to pull down cover image of comic being added.
* Add an API to pull down retail and market values of comic being added as well as ones that are already added but fluxuate in price.
* Ability to have the List view output 20/50 comics per page with multiple pages for easier viewing.
* More front end adjustments such as Search box margins, nav bar graphics, List table margins.



This project was created use IntelliJ as my IDE, Java, HeidiSQL to construct a MySQL databse, Play framework, HTML for the front-end.
